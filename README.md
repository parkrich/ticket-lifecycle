The ticket was assigned to Jane in Support, since the ticket was filed under Support and Jane is part of Support. This is an example of Jane keeping KAren in the loop about the issue and placing the proper urgency to get the ticket resolved. Jane resolves the ticket by updating the user and then marking it in the sytem as being closed and resolved.
